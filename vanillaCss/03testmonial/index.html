        so, in the company I joined. I
        honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
      <p class="card__details">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some
        people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
        enrolled
        shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
        course,
        I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        The program gave me the
        confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
        standard is
        above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

      <h1 class="card__subject">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
      <p class="card__details">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
        from professionals who can
        help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
        say
        wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and I
        never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
        learning to
        the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews
        as an
        example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
